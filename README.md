# Hospital-mini-server
# Introduction:
This project is a mini-server built using Node.js and Express.js to fetch available body organ data for transplantation within a hospital setting. The server provides an API through which clients can query and retrieve information about available organs for transplantation procedures.

API Endpoints:


GET: Fetch available organ data.
POST: Add new organ data.
PUT: Update details with authentication.
DELETE: Remove unhealthy organ.

By default, the server runs on port 3000.

Thank you!
